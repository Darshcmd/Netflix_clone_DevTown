# Netflix_clone_DevTown
This is a basic Netflix Clone I built as part of a 5-day bootcamp organized by **DevTown**. 
The goal of the bootcamp was to learn and build a frontend project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by replicating some key features of Netflix.

## What we did each day:

**Day 1: Home Page**
- Built a Netflix-style landing page
- Added a navigation bar and hero banner section

**Day 2: Categories**
- Created multiple movie/show categories
- Used horizontal scrolling and styled the cards

**Day 3: Wishlist**
- Added a feature to save shows to a wishlist
- Used local storage to keep data even after refreshing

**Day 4: Video Player**
- Created a simple video player setup
- Included play/pause and fullscreen support

**Day 5: Profile Page**
- Made a profile selection page
- Added mock user profiles and switched UI based on the selected profile  

## How to Run:
Just open the `index.html` file in your browser. Thatâ€™s it!
